{"name":"Andean School on Cosmology","tagline":"June 1 - 26, 2015. Universidad de los Andes, Bogot√°, Colombia.","body":"### Welcome to the Andean School on Cosmology\r\n\r\nThe Andean School on Cosmology wants to bring together students from the Andean region with world leading experts in the area of cosmology in its theoretical, numerical and observational aspects. \r\n\r\nThe objective is not only teach you about advanced topics in cosmology but also explore the possibility to **tackle and start real research projects** in collaboration with the lecturers.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\n\r\nThe School will run for 4 weeks from June 1st through June 26th, 2015. Each week will have a different focus.\r\nEach day of the The School will have daily lectures (1.5 hours), hands-on sessions (2.5 hours) plus free-format work on your own research at the _Colaboratorio_ (a computing lab at Uniandes). The course will have a total of 64 hours. \r\n\r\nDue to space limitations in the computing labs we have a limit of 25 students in the hands-on sessions. However, the lectures are open to a larger attendance.\r\n\r\nThe instruction languages will be English and Spanish.\r\n\r\n### Lecturers\r\n\r\n* [**Miguel Aragon-Calvo**](http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Aragon_Calvo_M/0/1/0/all/0/1) (Riverside) *To be confirmed\r\n* [**Florian Beutler**](http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/au:+Beutler_F/0/1/0/all/0/1) (Berkeley)\r\n* [**Jaime E.
